## 🤔 Information
This is my personal resolution for the __Event of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)__. 

According to its [author](http://was.tl/):

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

A good event to train any skill in any Language or just for problem resolution test.
